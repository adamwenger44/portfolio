                        My name is Adam Wenger. I am 21 years old and am currently taking classes at UNCC for a web
                        developement bootcamp. There is a bit of a backstory to why I am here today. I went to Pitt
                        Community College next to ECU out of high school, and the plan was to transfer to ECU acter I
                        completed my 2 years at Pitt. I enjoyed the freedom of college but I did not have the self
                        dicipline to complete my courses to the best of my ability. So I returned home.

                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                        I worked meaningless jobs for about a year until I found out my girlfriend was pregnant. My
                        friend got me a job in construction and it was a decent living, not great, but we were making
                        it. After a year of doing this I realized I wanted more with my life, my back was in pain every
                        day and I wasn't using the brain that I knew I could use.

                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                        Once I complete this program I hope to get a good job and be able to provide a good life for my
                        family.
